This viewer rotates cubes and octahedra in N dimensions.
You can type rotations into the boxes and animate with the sliders.

build with
  mvn clean package assembly:single
and in the target directory, execute with
  java -jar ShapeViewer-1.0.jar

In two dimensions, you can rotate a vertex around a point.
So a square, when it rotates, rotates around some center.

In three dimensions, each vertex can rotate around either
the x-axis, the y-axis, or the z-axis. 

In four dimensions, verticies actually rotate around planes,
namely the xy plane, the xz plane, the xt plane, the yz plane,
the yt plane, and the zt plane.

In n-dimensional space, you can rotate around n-2 dimensional
subspaces. In general, in n-dimensional space, there are
C(n,n-2) = n(n-1)/2 subspaces you can rotate around.

This is why the number of sliders change when you change the
number of dimensions.
